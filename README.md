<h1>BLACKJACK</h1>

A fast paced game, the objective is to get a card count of 21 or as close (without exceding) as you can.In order to win you have to beat the dealer, whoever has the best hand wins . Every time the dealer has a count of 17 or more, the dealer has to stand(hold the total and end the turn), otherwise , he must hit(request an extra card).
