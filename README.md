BLACKJACK 

A fast paced game, the objective is to get a card count of 21 or as close (without exceding) as you can.In order to win you have to beat the dealer, whoever has the best hand wins . Every time the dealer has a count of 17 or more, the dealer has to stand(hold the total and end the turn), otherwise , he must hit(request an extra card).

GOOD LUCK.

Me, as a player ,...
* I want to see my count, so I can focus more on the play that in the math of the cards.
* I want to have a double button, so I can win more if I got a good hand.
